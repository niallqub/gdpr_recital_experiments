      " In order to ensure a consistent level of protection for natural persons throughout the Union and to prevent divergences hampering the free movement of personal data within the internal market, a Regulation is necessary to provide legal certainty and transparency for economic operators, including micro, small and medium-sized enterprises, and to provide natural persons in all Member States with the same level of legally enforceable rights and obligations and responsibilities for controllers and processors, to ensure consistent monitoring of the processing of personal data, and equivalent sanctions in all Member States as well as effective cooperation between the supervisory authorities of different Member States. The proper functioning of the internal market requires that the free movement of personal data within the Union is not restricted or prohibited for reasons connected with the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data. To take account of the specific situation of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises, this Regulation includes a derogation for organisations with fewer than 250 employees with regard to record-keeping. In addition, the Union institutions and bodies, and Member States and their supervisory authorities, are encouraged to take account of the specific needs of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises in the application of this Regulation. The notion of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises should draw from Article 2 of the Annex to Commission Recommendation 2003/361/EC (1).\n",

      " In order to ensure a consistent level of protection for natural persons throughout the Union and to prevent divergences hampering the free movement of personal data within the internal market, a Regulation is necessary to provide legal certainty and transparency for economic operators, including micro, small and medium-sized enterprises, and to provide natural persons in all Member States with the same level of legally enforceable rights and obligations and responsibilities for controllers and processors, to ensure consistent monitoring of the processing of personal data, and equivalent sanctions in all Member States as well as effective cooperation between the supervisory authorities of different Member States. The proper functioning of the internal market requires that the free movement of personal data within the Union is not restricted or prohibited for reasons connected with the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data. To take account of the specific situation of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises, this Regulation includes a derogation for organisations with fewer than 250 employees with regard to record-keeping. In addition, the Union institutions and bodies, and Member States and their supervisory authorities, are encouraged to take account of the specific needs of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises in the application of this Regulation. The notion of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises should draw from Article 2 of the Annex to Commission Recommendation 2003/361/EC (1).\n",

The proper functioning of the internal market requires that the free movement of personal data within the Union is not restricted or prohibited for reasons connected with the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data.

In addition, the Union institutions and bodies, and Member States and their supervisory authorities, are encouraged to take account of the specific needs of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises in the application of this Regulation.

However, this communication is not required if the controller has implemented appropriate technical and organizational protection measures or subsequent measures that ensure the high risk no longer materializes, or if it would involve disproportionate effort. In these cases, there should be a public communication or similar measure whereby data subjects are informed in an equally effective manner.

While that obligation produces administrative and financial burdens, it did not in all cases contribute to improving the protection of personal data. Such indiscriminate general notification obligations should therefore be abolished, and replaced by effective procedures and mechanisms which focus instead on those types of processing operations which are likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons by virtue of their nature, scope, context and purposes. Such types of processing operations may be those which in, particular, involve using new technologies, or are of a new kind and where no data protection impact assessment has been carried out before by the controller, or where they become necessary in the light of the time that has elapsed since the initial processing.\n",

      "The intention behind abolishing general notification obligations under Directive 95/46/EC was to streamline and simplify the reporting requirements for personal data breaches, as outlined in the contextual data provided. Instead of requiring controllers to automatically notify supervisory authorities and affected individuals of all breaches, the new approach specifies that notifications should only be mandatory in certain circumstances. This approach is more targeted and allows for a more appropriate response to different types of breaches based on their nature, severity, and impact. The notification requirements outlined in paragraph 1 still apply but are now more specific and detailed, including information such as the categories and approximate number of affected individuals and records, as well as measures taken or proposed to address the breach. This helps to provide greater clarity and transparency for all parties involved while minimizing unnecessary burden and resources spent on reporting trivial incidents. Additionally, the use of codes of conduct (as mentioned in paragraph 2) and data protection certification mechanisms (referenced in Article 42) provides additional tools for ensuring compliance and monitoring of such breaches by controllers and processors. Overall, this approach aims to strike a better balance between protecting individuals' rights and preventing unauthorized access or disclosure of personal data, while also enabling organizations to respond effectively and efficiently to any breaches that do occur.\n",

If an extension is needed due to complexity, it may be granted for up to 6 additional weeks, with the authority informing the controller and processor of any delay. However, if there is no reaction from the supervisory authority within this timeframe, they can still intervene as per their tasks and powers laid down in the Regulation.\n",
